## Vision 

This project is to help every user, be it parents, children or other adults wishing to follow a particular career path find the right and updated opportunities towards achieving their life goals.

We understand and believe everyone out there is needed somewhere, and unless they are aware of where to access the right information, it can get fraustrating at times when one can't seem to find the right opportunities for them.

Our vision is to become the central go-to platform for students, recent graduates, and anyone seeking opportunities such as internships, scholarships, and jobs especially in the Technology industry. 

This platform will feature an array of opportunities that are easily sorted and filtered for users to access by location (Remote, Hybrid or Onsite), date(using timezone settings for expiry or not), requirements(both academic and soft skills), and benefits(Stipend, funding, and salary) and the direct link to those opportunities.

The platform will have a blog section where we share tips and general articles that align with our goals.

Through our platform, users will be provided with a one-stop-shop for reliable and up-to-date information on available opportunities updated by simpling using the search bar and typing key words. This will provide them a list of opportunities sorted as described above.

Moreover, we will also actively contribute to the open source community by creating a GitHub repository for users to upload opportunities they have collected, which will be reviewed by volunteered admins, and merged. 

We intend to post on our social media pages such as LinkIn, Twitter, facebook and TikTok for easier access. The social media will also include posts relating to how to apply, or more information about opportunity A or B. 

## Mission

Our mission is to connect users to the right opportunity by providing them with an array of options sorted by:

* location (*Remote, Hybrid or Onsite*), 
* Date(*from most recent*), 
* Requirements(*both academic and soft skills*), 
* Benefits(*Stipend, funding, and salary*) and 
* The direct link to those opportunities

We will strive to provide a platform that is reliable, efficient, and up-to-date. We will also actively contribute to the open source community by creating a GitHub repository for users to upload their opportunities. 

Furthermore, we will provide our users with a direct link to apply for the opportunity and post them on our social media pages for easier access. 

Ultimately, our goal is to become the go-to platform for students, recent graduates, and professionals who are seeking opportunities such as internships, scholarships, and jobs in the Technology sector.
